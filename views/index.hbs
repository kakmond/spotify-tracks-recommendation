				<p class="lead">
				Thank you for participating in this study. In this study, we try to get a deeper understanding on how music playlists are created in groups. We will ask you to collaborate with four other persons to curate songs for a 10-song playlist.
				</p><p class="lead">
				In the next step, we will first gather your top 10 songs that you have listened to. We will ask you to select one song that you would like to use as your reference song. This song will be used to select songs for you and your group to curate for the playlists, as well as for finding four other group members with a similar taste to yours.
				</p><p class="lead">
				After selecting one song as a reference song, we will ask you and each member of the group to assess songs to add to the playlist (everyone will assess the same song individually but simultaneously). You can indicate whether you would want this song to be added to the playlist (by selecting "yes" or "maybe yes") or not (by selecting "maybe no" or "no").
				</p><p class="lead">
				When you have provided your assessment, we wait until every group member has given their response. Once all responses have been gathered, we will present the response of each group member <u>anonymously</u>. Seeing the other group members preferences, you have the opportunity to revise your initial response. Similarly, the other group members may adapt their response..
				</p><p class="lead">
				Once everybody has given their final judgment on the song, the final judgments of each group member -- together with the names -- are presented. Only songs that are given an <u>unanimous</u> positive response (i.e., "yes" or "maybe yes") will be added to the playlist. Songs without an unanimous positive feedback will not be added to the playlist. After a decision about a song has been made, another song will be suggested with the same procedure until a playlist of 10 songs has been reached.
				</p><p class="lead">
				Once a consensus has been reached for a playlist with 10 songs, you will be given the opportunity to save the playlist to your Spotify account at the end of the study. We will conclude the study with a few questions on your group playlist.

				Good luck!
