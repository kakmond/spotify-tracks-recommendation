				In this study we try to get a deeper understanding on how music playlist can be created. In this study you will be asked to create a playlist with a group of people with a similar music taste. To match music taste with the group members and to provide songs to curate for the playlist, we ask to get access to your Spotify account. 
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				We expect that a playlist with 10 songs can be created with your group within 10 minutes. After that we have a short questionnaire to ask about your experiences.
